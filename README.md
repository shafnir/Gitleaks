# 🔐 Gitleaks Custom Config – Ready for Secure Git Scanning

This repository provides a **production-ready `gitleaks.toml` config file** with custom rules to detect real-world secrets in Git repositories.

It helps DevSecOps teams, security engineers, and developers:

- Detect hardcoded secrets and credentials  
- Avoid false positives  
- Integrate easily into CI/CD pipelines  

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

✅ Custom rules for detecting:

- Passwords (`password`, `pass`, `passwd`, etc.)  
- Environment secrets (like `DB_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_TOKEN`)  
- API keys  
- Client secrets  
- Private keys  
- JWT tokens  
- Database-specific secrets  
- Generic auth credentials  

✅ Optimized for GitHub Actions or CLI usage

📁 File Structure
```bash
repo
├── .gitleaks.toml # Custom rules file
└── .github
    └── workflows
        └── gitleaks.yml # Gitleaks main configuration file

```

## Scanning Last Commit Only (CI/CD Use)  
If you're using Gitleaks in a CI/CD pipeline and want to scan only the latest commit (not the full history):  
Copy the configuration from `conf/gitleaks-latest-commit.yml`, into `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` as of the above file structure.

This approach is ideal for fast, focused scans with minimal noise during push events or pull requests.

## Scanning Full Git History (All Commits)  
To scan the entire commit history of the branch, Copy the configuration from `conf/gitleaks-all-commits.yml`,  
into `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` as of the above file structure.

This is great for performing a full audit on legacy repositories or before open-sourcing a project.

## Scanning Locally (CLI)
To run Gitleaks manually with any of these configs (in the source code directory):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gitleaks -y
gitleaks detect --source . --config .gitleaks.toml
```

```bash
